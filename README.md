# PencariMovie Downloader

Local Telegram file downloader.

This app runs on your own device and opens in your browser. It searches PencariMovie results, resolves Telegram file links when needed, then downloads or plays supported files through the local downloader.

## FAQ

### ❓ What does it do?

- **Direct bot server connection** – Talks straight to Telegram’s MTProto, which is faster than going through a normal user client.
- **No Telegram client needed** – Everything runs in your web browser; no app, no installation.
- **Zero dependencies** – A standalone script powered by FrankenPHP. No PHP, no web server, nothing extra to install.

### ❓ Why do I need it?

- **Privacy first** – Log in with just a bot token, no phone number required. (Ask a family member or friend with Telegram to create a bot for you – it’s super easy.)
- **Works on any device** – Smart TVs, TV boxes, car tablets… if it has a browser, it works. Just open `http://your-lan-ip:port`.
- **Straight to the point** – No cluttered chats, no channels, no bot search. Just pure, focused file searching.

### ❓ How do I get started?

1. Get a bot token from [@CreateNewTelegramBot](https://t.me/CreateNewTelegramBot?start=localserver) (takes 30 seconds).
2. Run the script and open the web panel.
3. Start searching and downloading instantly.

## Stremio / Nuvio Addon

The server includes a built‑in addon compatible with Stremio (and Nuvio). Once the server is running and a bot token is configured, you can add it to your Stremio client:

- **Addon URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8088` (or replace with your LAN IP if accessing from another device).
- **Endpoints**:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:8088/manifest.json` – addon manifest (automatically used when you add the base URL).

### How to install in Stremio

1. Open Stremio.
2. Go to **Addons** → **Community Addons**.
3. In the **Addon URL** field, enter `http://127.0.0.1:8088/manifest.json` (or your local IP if the server is on another device).
4. Click **Install**.
5. The addon will appear in your addon list; you can now browse and play content from your PencariMovie library.

### Requirements

- The server must be running and the bot token must be validated (the web panel will guide you through setup).
- The addon uses the same token – no additional configuration is needed.
- For streaming, ensure your Stremio player can handle the media formats returned by the server.

## Warning

- Use only on a trusted private network.
- Do not expose your bot token or session files.

## Download and run

### Android App

ARM64
https://github.com/aiskendi/pencarimovie-downloader/releases/download/v1.0.1/pencarimovie_arm64-v8a.apk

On every Start the APK checks GitHub `releases/latest`. If a newer tag exists it downloads `pencarimovie-downloader-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` and extracts it over the app folder, leaving `storage/` (bot session) in place.

### Termux (Android)

The Google Play version of Termux will not work correctly. Install Termux from the official GitHub releases page instead: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases

For most modern Android phones with ARM64 CPUs, this APK should work: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/download/v0.118.3/termux-app_v0.118.3+github-debug_arm64-v8a.apk

Universal arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86, and x86_64: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/download/v0.118.3/termux-app_v0.118.3+github-debug_universal.apk

```bash
pkg install wget proot -y && wget https://github.com/aiskendi/pencarimovie-downloader/releases/download/v1.0.1/pencarimovie-termux.sh && bash pencarimovie-termux.sh
```

```bash
bash pencarimovie-termux.sh
bash pencarimovie-termux.sh --stop
bash pencarimovie-termux.sh --restart
```

On every start the installer checks GitHub `releases/latest`. If a newer tag exists it downloads that package and extracts it over the app folder, leaving `storage/` (bot session) in place.

### Windows

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/aiskendi/pencarimovie-downloader/releases/download/v1.0.1/pencarimovie-windows.bat" -OutFile "pencarimovie-windows.bat" -UseBasicParsing; .\pencarimovie-windows.bat
```

```text
.\pencarimovie-windows.bat           # Start
.\pencarimovie-windows.bat --stop    # Stop
.\pencarimovie-windows.bat --restart # Restart
```

On Windows the running server also adds a **system tray icon**. Double-click it to open the app, or right-click for **Open** / **Stop Server**.

On every start the installer checks GitHub `releases/latest`. If a newer tag exists it downloads that package and extracts it over the app folder, leaving `storage/` (bot session) in place.

### Linux

```bash
curl -L -o pencarimovie-linux.sh https://github.com/aiskendi/pencarimovie-downloader/releases/download/v1.0.1/pencarimovie-linux.sh && bash pencarimovie-linux.sh
```

```bash
bash pencarimovie-linux.sh
bash pencarimovie-linux.sh --stop
bash pencarimovie-linux.sh --restart
```

On every start the installer checks GitHub `releases/latest`. If a newer tag exists it downloads that package and extracts it over the app folder, leaving `storage/` (bot session) in place.

### macOS (not yet tested)

Choose the correct macOS package for your Mac:

- Apple Silicon: `pencarimovie-downloader-mac-arm64.tar.gz`
- Intel Mac: `pencarimovie-downloader-mac-x86_64.tar.gz`

```bash
mkdir pencarimovie-server && cd pencarimovie-server && curl -L -o pencarimovie.tar.gz https://github.com/aiskendi/pencarimovie-downloader/releases/download/v1.0.1/pencarimovie-downloader-mac-arm64.tar.gz && tar -xzf pencarimovie.tar.gz && bash start.sh
```

### On Browser

Open the local app:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8088
```

On first launch, the app shows the bot-token setup screen before the search page.

1. Paste your Telegram bot token in the **Bot Token** field.
2. Click **Validate**.
3. The token is also synced to PencariMovie.com for webhook setup.
4. After validation succeeds, the homepage opens.

On subsequent launches, the existing session resumes automatically. If the session expires, the setup screen appears again for re-login.

**Security**: The bot token is never stored on disk. Only the MadelineProto session file (`storage/session.madeline`) persists after login. The bot ID comes from `getSelf()`, not token parsing. The `/api/config` endpoint has been removed — no credentials are exposed via the API.

Do not share your session files, or bot token with other people.
